JSX syntax is based on XML, not HTML. This is why JSX is more strict:

- Tags must be properly closed
- Tag names are case-sensitive.
- Attribute names use camelCase (e.g., className instead of class).

These rules come from XML’s stricter syntax, which JSX follows to ensure consistency and avoid ambiguity when representing UI as code.
