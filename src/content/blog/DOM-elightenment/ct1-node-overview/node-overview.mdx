# The Document Object Model is a hierarchy tree of JS node Objects

- The DOM (Document Object Model) is an object-oriented representation of an HTML or XML document. It allows us to access and manipulate the structure, style, and content of web documents as a tree of nodes 

## Example

```html
<div>
  <p>Hello <b>World</b></p>
</div>
```

## Rendered tree

- Document
  - html
    - body
      - div
        - p
          - "Hello** "**
          - b
            - "World"


## Node Object Types
- DOCUMENT_NODE (window.document)
- ELEMENT_NODE (`<body/>` `<a/>` `<p/>` ...) 
- ATTRIBUTE_NODE (`class="funEdges"`)
- TEXT_NODE (text caracters in HTML document)
- DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE (document.createDocumentFragment())
- DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE (`<!DOCTYPE html>`)

The DOM tree contains different types of nodes, not just elements. To work with them programmatically, JavaScript needs a way to distinguish between them.

Each node object in the DOM has a numeric value called nodeType. This value identifies what kind of node it is (for example, element, text, comment, document, etc.).

The numeric value makes it easy for code to identify and work with different node types in the DOM.

```for (let key in Node) {
  if (typeof Node[key] === "number") {
    console.log(key, "=", Node[key]);
  }
}
